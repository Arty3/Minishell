<h6 align="center"><em>Standalone Unix C Bash Clone</em></h6>

## üìù Overview

This project is a standalone Unix [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) clone made in C.<br>
It was developed as part of my study's curriculum in collaboration with a teammate.

View the project's requirements and guidelines here: [subject](./extra/en.subject.pdf)

The shell is written in C and compiled using the GNU17 C standard and the [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) compiler. It is developed for Unix based platforms.

See it in action [here](#-showcase).

### Disclaimers

Please note that the project required the use of [Norminette](https://github.com/42school/norminette), a code styling guide. This severely hinders the code base and forced us to write poorly maintainable code, you can read further here: [en.norm.pdf](https://github.com/42school/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf). Unfortunately, this is a requirement, I'm personally strictly against this styling standard.

We completed the bonus section as well, though, the subject requires us to split the bonus sources from the mandatory ones and create a [Makefile](./Makefile) `bonus` compilation rule. I stripped this, and instead combined all sources into a single binary.

I removed the norminette-required banners. These are banners which allows the school to view who created and last updated a file. They're required by norminette in order to pass. I stripped these from the project for the sake of privacy.

My [Libft](https://github.com/DontCallMeLuca/Libft) was used for this project. I added it as a git submodule, it could be that some minor things have changed, since it received updates since this project was concluded.

- [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/s/make/manual/make.html)
- [readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html)

### ‚≠ê Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DontCallMeLuca/Minishell.git
```

2. cd into it:

```sh
cd Minishell
```

### ‚öô Makefile

#### Build Release

```sh
make all
```

#### Clean Build

```sh
make clean
```

## üíª Usage

### ‚ú® Quick Start

Running minishell is as easy as:

```sh
./minishell
```

From there, use it as you would a regular shell.

Note that extensive syntax features like `\` or `;` are not<br>
implemented as these are strictly forbidden by the subject.

For the implemented features, the behavior replicates that of Bash exactly.
